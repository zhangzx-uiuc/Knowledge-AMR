### Covid-19 Dataset 
The training and testing splits for our Covid-19 dataset (for entity and event trigger extraction) are released in the `./covid_data/` folder. There are 25 fine-grained entity types and 14 event types (described in Table 6 in the paper.)

We will release our model code soon. Thanks so much for your patience.
